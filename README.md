1. Select an Element by ID - There is a two-step sequence when controlling an element in the DOM with JavaScript. First, you access the element, and then you can either read its contents or manipulate it somehow. There are several ways to access specific elements in the DOM. I'll select an element by its ID, with the getElementById() method.
2. Select Elements by Tag Name - knowing the tag name of the element, I can use getElementsByTagName(). This method returns an HTMLCollection of elements with the given tag name.
3. Select Elements by Class Name - When working with HTML, you'll often set class attributes on elements and apply styles to them with CSS. The document object provides a way to select elements in the DOM with a given class name with document.getElementsByClassName().
4. Use CSS Queries to Select Page Elements - querySelector() and querySelectorAll() are the most flexible of all the DOM selector methods. They accept ID's, classes, tag names, and just about any valid CSS selector.
5. Get and Set Content with textContent and innerHTML - Learned two properties that provide ways to read and update content in the DOM, textContent and innerHTML.
6. Change Element Attributes - HTML tags are converted into objects (called nodes) and placed into the DOM. Attributes exist as properties of element objects, like the href attribute of an <a> element or the action attribute of a <form> element. You get or set those attributes by way of properties, similar to the way you did earlier with an input element's value property and a heading's textContent property.
7. Set Inline Styles with the style Property - Like most other attributes, you can get and set the inline style of an element in the DOM with the style property. However, unlike most other attributes, the style property returns an object containing a list of CSS style properties.   
8. Create New DOM Elements - create new elements and add them to the page. First, I'll create a new element with document.createElement()
9. Append Nodes - I've learned how to create elements with JavaScript, but the newly created elements won't appear on the page until you add them to the DOM. Use the append() method to insert a new node inside a parent node.
